To get started:

- Create a class derived from eqQt::QtMainWindow. This will contain your GUI,
  and an eqQt::QtGLWidget (or a derived class) as an OpenGL viewport.
  
- Create a class derived from eqQt::QtGLContextCreator. This is a helper class
  to create OpenGL contexts in the main thread, which is necessary in Qt.
  This class has to override the contextRequestEvent function. A typical
  implementation might look like this:
  
    void ContextCreator::contextRequestEvent( eqQt::QtGLContextRequestEvent* pEvent )
    {
      MainWindow* pMW = new MainWindow( pEvent->getQtWindow() );
      pMW->show();
    }
  
- In your main() function:
  - Create the QApplication instance:
      QApplication q;
  - Create your context creator instance:
      ContextCreator cc;
  - Start Equalizer in a separate thread (i.e., create a thread that does in
    its run() what eqPly or eVolve do in main()).
  - Run the Qt event loop:
      int result = q.exec();
